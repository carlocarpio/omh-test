Instruction:
1. Clone the Repository
2. Install Modules (npm i / ```yarn```)
3. Run the App (npm run start / ```yarn start```)

Library used:
1. ```react-google-maps``` for rendering the app
2. ```axios``` for api services calls
3. ```lodash```
4. ```redux/react-redux``` for managing app state
5. ```redux-persist``` for persisting app state
6. ```bulma``` for css framework
7. ```node-sass``` for scss styling

Issues:
1. I can't seem to find the photo in the response,
    I only saw a result (response.result.photos.html_attributions)
    and it contains a link with href and it is not a link for image.
    I only added an info box when the marker is click as this is where
    i will render images.
